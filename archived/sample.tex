\section{Introduction}
This is a sample LaTeX document to demonstrate how to convert a TeX file into a PDF using Python and the \texttt{pylatex} library.

\section{Section with Math}
Here is an example of a mathematical equation:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\end{equation}

\section{Section with Image}
You can also include images in your LaTeX document. Here's an example:

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.png}
    \caption{An example image}
    \label{fig:example-image}
\end{figure}

Note that the \texttt{example\_image.png} file should be present in the same directory as this \texttt{sample.tex} file.

\section{Conclusion}
This concludes the sample LaTeX document. You can customize and extend it as needed for your purposes.
