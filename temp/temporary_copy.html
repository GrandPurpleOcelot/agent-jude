The user navigates to the login page of the web application.<br />2. The user is presented with two input fields: one for the username and one for the password.<br />3. The user enters their registered username and password into the respective fields.<br />4. The user clicks the 'Login' button to authenticate.<br />5. If the credentials are correct, the system redirects the user to their personal dashboard.<br />6. If the credentials are incorrect, the system displays an error message and allows the user to attempt to log in again.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Post-condition</p></td><td><p>Upon successful login, the user is redirected to their personal dashboard and has access to their personal and application-specific data.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Acceptance Criteria</p></td><td><p>1. The login page must have input fields for both username and password.<br />2. The password input field should obscure the characters entered.<br />3. An error message is displayed if either the username or password is incorrect.<br />4. The user is redirected to their dashboard upon successful login.<br />5. The system should lock the user out after five unsuccessful login attempts.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Edge Case</p></td><td><p>1. If the user enters an email address instead of a username, the system should still recognize and authenticate the user if the email address is associated with a registered account.<br />2. If the user forgets their password, there should be a 'Forgot Password' link to initiate a password reset process.<br />3. The login process should be secure and resistant to common security threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</p></td></tr></table>
